         <p> I found this article very interesting and informative. It has a lot of good design advice that I only think about when I’m filling out a form or complaining about it, not when I’m making a form. I think by having the multi steps visible on the site as the person fills out the form hooks the consumer in and keeps them engaged because they can see their progress and know when the task of filling out the form will be complete. When someone sees they have completed 2 out of 3 steps or 5 out of 7 steps and so on, they are more invested to stay with the form. I agree a lot with tip number six which is to put the format requirements below the input as sometimes I’ll input something in a form and only then will a pop-up tell me I did it incorrectly. For example, I find that very annoying if I’m trying to write down a password to save for later and then a pop-up tells me I did not meet the site’s minimum requirements for a password. </p>

        <p> It was interesting to know that placeholder text is ineffective because the minute you start typing you immediately forget what you were supposed to be typing in that box and it is no longer there. The tab key is also a good option to have. I usually use the enter key for movement through the form rather than the tab key. I like the idea of avoiding negative language and being soft about trying to get the information you want. It makes the person more willing to engage rather than just want to get the task over with.  A form I recently just filled out was the DMV permit application. It used many of the strategies discussed in this article such as multiple steps being shown and also having the most sensitive information or asking for a credit card at the end point in the form because by then I was invested in completing and turning in the form. </p>
