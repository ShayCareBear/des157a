                 <p>This article is very informative on the ways we can guide our thinking to deconstruct and decode images. It made me think about my own consumption of images and how I scan through a large number of images on a daily basis in social media but I rarely stop to really examine any in detail to realize what goes into it. I think the best piece of advice in this piece to me was asking open-ended questions and to examine  details about what they noticed in the piece and how they were able to put together a scene just from that.  The picture that went with Expand Your Knowledge of the World really stuck out to me because I had heard about the story and knew it was awful. The reality of  seeing in the photographs brings home how horrendous the treatment was. I hope to carry this mindset of looking at pictures and expand on my understanding, as the article stated, so that I can expand my knowledge of the world in my visual learning skills. The website I chose to look at was from the unfounded studio: Ania's website. I really loved how vibrant and artistic her website was with all of the text images moved in such a fun fashion. It really inspired me to look at all of this artists’ work and I think they did a good job at the bottom as well with putting some big name clients there before one gets to her email address. This really stuck out as somebody who’s done a lot of work. I loved all the hover and idol animations of her gallery and the hover over the mouse also give an interesting luck to the pieces as well adding on to this artisan style of work.  </p>

         <p> After reading the article Best Practices for Overlays, I have come to have a better understanding of when to use overlays, how to implement them and when they might be an issue that negatively impacts the user. I already knew it was good practice to implement key presses for accessibility but for me it’s also about the convenience of using key presses when you’re going through websites. It feels like it should be intuitive to have key presses. Looking at the anatomy of the moral window I realize that the title should be bigger than I had originally planned but it makes sense to describe where the user has moved on the page. I also realize that my initial pop-up might have exceeded the 50% of the screen overlay and I’ll be redesigning it to fit within a smaller frame. I’ll make sure not to confuse my user with too many button options that contradict each other.  </p>

             <p> I found this article very interesting and informative. It has a lot of good design advice that I only think about when I’m filling out a form or complaining about it, not when I’m making a form. I think by having the multi steps visible on the site as the person fills out the form hooks the consumer in and keeps them engaged because they can see their progress and know when the task of filling out the form will be complete. When someone sees they have completed 2 out of 3 steps or 5 out of 7 steps and so on, they are more invested to stay with the form. I agree a lot with tip number six which is to put the format requirements below the input as sometimes I’ll input something in a form and only then will a pop-up tell me I did it incorrectly. For example, I find that very annoying if I’m trying to write down a password to save for later and then a pop-up tells me I did not meet the site’s minimum requirements for a password. </p>
    
            <p> It was interesting to know that placeholder text is ineffective because the minute you start typing you immediately forget what you were supposed to be typing in that box and it is no longer there. The tab key is also a good option to have. I usually use the enter key for movement through the form rather than the tab key. I like the idea of avoiding negative language and being soft about trying to get the information you want. It makes the person more willing to engage rather than just want to get the task over with.  A form I recently just filled out was the DMV permit application. It used many of the strategies discussed in this article such as multiple steps being shown and also having the most sensitive information or asking for a credit card at the end point in the form because by then I was invested in completing and turning in the form. </p>
