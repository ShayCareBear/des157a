            <h1>Shay's Project Breif!</h1>

            <h2>Choosen: Every Picture Project!</h2>
          
            <p>For the Every Picture Project I decided to do an Art Archive, I will be improving the overall design and interactivity of this page. </p>

          

            <div id="ex">
            <img src="images/ex1.PNG" alt="image of site"> 
            </div>

            <p> For my final project I plan on improving project number two which is my art archive site . With this site I am going to try and correct some visual design and improve some UX and UI design. For the design I just want to make it look more professional and organized.  I’m considering breaking up the static look of my site from just the street scroll down to having things on the side. I am also considering adding more journals to allow for more content and having them displayed differently on the page. I want to play with the background and see if I can get an even better background that helps my images and text pop so it is a better visual experience.  <p>

             <p>I will also look into different topography as I think I can improve that aspect as well. For the Ux/UI I am going to make it so that the journals light up whenever the user is over them showing that they are clickable. This will incorporate one of the feedbacks I received from my peers. I’ll also do a similar thing with the bottom images, assuming those are images people didn’t realize they could hover over and interact with. I will try to put some hints within the UX and UI to show people that they can interact with that feature. </p>

             <p>For expert feedback I plan on getting help from the undergrad design tutor on design and UX/UI.I have a professor in Design 191B that I will also ask for UX/UI feedback. They have made many visual projects related to AI. I will also have some artist friends examine the site and see how well they like it and how to improve it. </p>
