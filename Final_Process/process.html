           <p>I'm trying to accomplish a cleaner and easier to use website. I think with these changes I can make the flow of content easier for the user to digest rather than the appearance that it is broken into pieces and with few or no hints of how to interact with the page. This will make my website easier to understand and more enjoyable for the user to look at. I will also have time to re-optimize my images. I tried editing the file size down on the last website but some of the images were still chunky and laggy. This will give me the opportunity to try a different method of editing and condensing my images</p>
